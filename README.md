Repository of tasks and projects which were during my minor course "Modeling of statistical dependencies"

## module_work_1
In this module work, the task of creating linear regression model for data about air quality in Indian cities was given. At first, dataset was previously explored during explaratory data analysis in order to know how features correlate with each other and remove outliers from the dataset. Next, basic linear regression model was built and heteroskedasticity tests were provided to find out if there is correlation betweeen predicted values and residuals. Then, Ridge and Lasso regularization were applied to the model to reduce features which don't impact on the target value significantly. Finally, polynomial features were created to increase R-squared of the regression model. 

## module_work_2
In this module work, 4 tasks were completed:
- task1 - building linear regression model for non-linear equations
- task2 - creating polynomial features for dataset in order to increase R-squared
- task3 - PCA analysis for reduction of number of feature in dataset
- task4 - building logistic regression model and evaluation of quality of the model using metrics
