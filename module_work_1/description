In this module work, the task of creating linear regression model for data about air quality in Indian cities was given. At first, dataset was previously explored during explaratory data analysis in order to know how features correlate with each other and remove outliers from the dataset. Next, basic linear regression model was built and heteroskedasticity tests were provided to find out if there is correlation betweeen predicted values and residuals. Then, Ridge and Lasso regularization were applied to the model to reduce features which don't impact on the target value significantly. Finally, polynomial features were created to increase R-squared of the regression model.
